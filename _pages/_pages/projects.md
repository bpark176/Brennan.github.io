Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on — ranging from robotics and mathematical modeling to environmental research and software design.  
Each project represents a mix of technical curiosity, collaboration, and experimentation — etc etc etc.

## Robotics & Engineering

### RoboShare Platform
A student-led initiative providing part exchanges, scrimmage coordination, and community outreach for VEX robotics teams — etc etc etc.  
**Role:** Head of Marketing & Branding  
**Highlights:** Organized scrimmages, built outreach partnerships, and managed brand identity.

## Mathematical Modeling

### HiMCM Problem A — Emergency Evacuation Sweeps
Developed a comparative model analyzing CNN-based and Vision-Language Model (VLM) approaches for real-time disaster detection on edge devices (Raspberry Pi) — etc etc etc.  
**Work:** Mathematical formulation, path optimization, LaTeX documentation, and algorithmic justification.

## Environmental Research

### Invasive Species Dynamics — Burmese Python in Florida
Created an ecological and policy-focused model describing the population growth and environmental impact of Burmese pythons — etc etc etc.  
**Methods:** Field data analysis, mapping, and simulation.
