Hi! I’m a student at Seoul International School with a strong interest in mathematics and how it can be applied to create things that genuinely benefit people. I enjoy exploring math both in theory and in application, from problem-solving and modeling to using mathematical ideas in engineering, technology, and real-world decision-making. What draws me to math most is its ability to turn abstract ideas into practical solutions. I like working on projects that combine math with creativity—whether that’s designing systems, modeling real-world scenarios, or experimenting with ideas that could have a meaningful impact.

This website serves as a platform where I document the projects I create and the research I conduct, along with notes, experiments, and ideas that I find interesting along the way. It’s meant to be a living record of my learning and growth, and a space to share projects as they evolve.
