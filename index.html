About
Hi. I am a freshman studying mathematics at Dartmouth College.

I’ve participated in various reading groups for mathematical texts like G. Folland’s Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and their Applications, and am looking to dive deeper into how advanced mathematics can be applied to real-world situations. Although I’ve been really into analysis during high school, I’m eager to branch out and learn more, especially fields like algebraic geometry and number theory. I’ve done research in mathematical analysis, and more details concerning this can be seen here.

My website will be where I document my progress in mathematics and also upload posts on anything I find interesting, whether that be based on a paper I’m writing or just something cool I found in a textbook I’m reading. Feel free contact me for anything, my socials are linked in the author profile of the website.
